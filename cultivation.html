            Pakalolo grown plants live the majority of their lives in the same 4x4 bed using a method called no-till farming. No-till farming is exactly what it sounds like. The soil in the beds is treated like a living organism along with the plants themselves. There are earthworms, microbes, nematodes, beneficial bacteria and fungi living in the soil which is never replaced (or tilled).

            This creates an ecosystem in each of the 4x4 beds with millions of microbes breaking down crop residues and releasing nutrients back into the soil (notice the green grass cover). The no-till method makes for better organic matter and water retention, increases the cycling of nutrients and the amount of water that infiltrates the soil which allows for each successive batch of plants to evolve into better looking, smelling and tasting flower with higher cannabinoid and terpene content.

By all-natural we mean there are no synthetic additives or bottles nutrients involved in the cultivation process at any point. We strongly believe that providing a natural grow medium, as well as preparing and combining natural ingredients for nutrients, will result in the best looking, smelling and tasting marijuana possible. Did someone say terpenes!?

        <div class="cultContent">
            Research on cannabis over the past decade has shown that terpenes are the key to producing flower with strong aroma and amazing flavor. Studies show they are produced at a higher rate in cannabis grown naturally among other factors. Terpenes are pungent aromatic and flavorful oils secreted from the same cannabinoid glands that produce THC/CBD. However, we are now beginning to learn that terpenes like Myrcene offer much more than just aroma and flavor.

                    The Pua Mana 1st Hawaiian Pakalolo seed bank is located among the Hawaiian Islands.  A seed bank that was founded with the purpose of not only breeding new and unique Hawaiian strains, but preserving the authentic landrace Hawaiian genetics of old that everyone knows and loves such as Maui Wowie and Kona Gold. Starting in the late 1970s a marijuana eradication program called Operation Green Harvest was put into action and funded by the Drug Enforcement Agency. This program involved the cooperation of local and state narcotics officers using whatever means necessary to destroy any and all marijuana plants and seeds on the Hawaii Islands.

                <p id="slideDesc1b">
                    Still in place today the program has sadly caused some of the original landrace strains from Hawaii to go extinct. However, the Pua Mana 'Ohana takes pride in making sure that never happens again and their passion translates into high quality genetics with lineage that begins with some of the oldest known landrace strains in the world. We are honored to work with the Pua Mana Pakalolo 1st Seed Bank and extend their 'Ohana to the interior of Alaska. We in turn take pride and put great passion into naturally cultivating these storied seeds into the best tasting and smelling marijuana on Earth.

                    We support our cultivation using all-natural, made in-house nutrients using Korean Natural Farming methods (KNF). We purchase fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs from the local co-op grocery store as well as collect our own cannabis waste, then break it all down and ferment it to make fermented plant juice (FPJ) and fermented fruit juice(FFJ). The fermentation process extracts and activates nutrients required by cannabis plants in their vegetative and flowering stages such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium as well as micro nutrients, trace minerals and enzymes. We water our plants with sprouted seed teas from different grains and legumes which provide growth enzymes and hormones for our cannabis plants throughout their lives. We also brew compost tea for watering which fortifies the soil by adding microbes to increase the vitality of our living and breathing no-till flower beds.

                  The SPYDRx PLUS is designed for close proximity in a controlled environment agriculture (thats what we do) in an aluminum alloy chassis with integrated heatsink for longevity and passive, natural convection thermal management allowing for no fans or moving components. The SPYDRx PLUS only uses a mere 685 watts while outputting more intensity than a 1000 watt high pressure sodium. It uses the PhysioSpec Indoor spectrum, a full-cycle spectrum optimized for rapid growth and complete plant development.  Tailored for growing plants through every stage: germination, clones/cuttings, mothers, vegetative and flowering applications in indoor environments.  With a CRI rating of 85, PhysioSpec Indoor offers a beautiful work and research environment with vivid colors and greater contrast to study the health of your crop. Its output is similar in look and feel to sunlight.

                    As we have mentioned, we pride ourselves on focusing on the look smell and taste of our flower by using all-natural cultivation methods. Research on cannabis over the past decade has shown that terpenes are the key to accomplising this goal and are produced at a higher rate in cannabis grown naturally among other factors. Terpenes are pungent aromatic and flavorful oils secreted from the cannabinoid glands that produce THC/CBD. Even more exciting is the fact that research has began to show that terpenes offer much more than just aroma and flavor.
